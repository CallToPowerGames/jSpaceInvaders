jSpaceInvaders
--------------
Space Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which
the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally across
the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens.
The aim is to defeat five rows of thirteen aliens that move horizontally
back and forth across the screen as they advance towards the bottom of the screen.
The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon.
As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement speeds up.
The aliens attempt to destroy the cannon by firing at it while they
approach the bottom of the screen.
If they reach the bottom, the alien invasion is successful and the game ends.
A special "mystery ship" will occasionally move across the top of the screen
and award bonus points if destroyed.
