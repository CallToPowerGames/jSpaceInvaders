Space Invaders is an arcade video game designed by Tomohiro Nishikado
and released in 1978.
It was originally manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan, and was later
licensed for production in the United States by the Midway division of Bally.
Space Invaders is one of the earliest shooting games and the aim
is to defeat waves of aliens with a laser cannon to earn as many points as possible.
In designing the game, Nishikado drew inspiration from popular media:
Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars.
To complete it, he had to design custom hardware and development tools.
Though simple by today's standards, with basic two-dimensional graphics,
it was one of the forerunners of modern video gaming and helped expand the
video game industry from a novelty to a global industry.
When first released, Space Invaders was very successful and popular.
Following its release, the game caused a temporary shortage of 100-yen
coins in Japan, and by 2007 had earned Taito US$500 million in revenue.
Guinness World Records ranks it the top arcade game.
The game has been the inspiration for other video games, re-released on numerous
platforms, and led to several sequels.
The 1980 Atari 2600 version quadrupled the system's sales and became the
first 'killer app' for video game consoles. Space Invaders has been referenced
and parodised in multiple television shows, and been a part of several video game and
cultural exhibitions. The pixelated enemy alien has become a media icon representing
video games as a whole.
