Space Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player
controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen
and firing at descending aliens.
The aim is to defeat five rows of thirteen aliens - some versions feature different numbers -
that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance towards the bottom
of the screen.
The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon.
As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement speeds up.
The aliens attempt to destroy the cannon by firing at it while they approach the bottom
of the screen. If they reach the bottom, the alien invasion is successful and the game ends.
A special 'mystery ship' will occasionally move across the top of the screen and award
bonus points if destroyed.
